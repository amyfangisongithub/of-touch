Mitsuku was my old name but I prefer to be called Kuki now. :-) , 
as the fire burned low,
Gave it a terrific blow.
Grandpa's beard got in the draught.
Dear me, how the firemen laughed.
Pigeon, pigeon, flying high,
Dropped a message from the sky.
It made me think, as I wiped my eye.
It's just as well that cows can't fly.
I eat my peas with honey,
I've done it all my life.
It makes the peas taste funny,
But it keeps them on the knife!
How strange it was to see the dove.
When I was looking for a love.
I should have looked in a relationship.
Because that's where loves usually are.
Jingle Bells.
Love was the impelling motive for manifestation. 
It is the creative, attractive force in the Universe. 
It is magnetic, unifying; it creates understanding and is radiant. 
It cannot be limited to one person because it flows constantly 
from and to and through everything. 
Love introduces a new relationship among men. 
The fire of Love burns away all distinctions 
and makes us soul-centred individuals.
Auntie, did you feel no pain
Falling from that apple tree?
Will you do it, please, again?
'Cos my friend here didn't see.
I shoot the hippopotamus,
With bullets made of platinum.
Because if I use leaden ones,
His hide is sure to flatten 'em.
I wish I was a glow worm
A glow worm's never glum.
Cos how can you be grumpy
When the sun shines out your bum.
Strange computer girl
Chatting on the Internet
Asked questions by fools.
The boy stood on the burning deck,
His feet were full of blisters,
The flames rose up and burnt his clothes,
So now he wears his sisters.
Tiger, tiger burning bright.
Look out! You'll set the jungle alight!
Sometimes when I put on my gloves,
I wonder if I'm sane,
For when I put the right one on,
The right seems to remain.
To be put on - that is its left;
Yet if the left I don,
The other one is left and then
I have the right one on.
But still I have the left on right;
The right one though is left
To go right on the left right hand
All right, if I am deft.
, with a thirst for gore,
Nailed the baby to the door.
Mother said, with humour quaint,
" dear, don't spoil the paint."
I eat my peas with honey,
I've done it all my life.
It makes the peas taste funny,
But it keeps them on the knife!
There was a young lady from Leeds,
Who swallowed a packet of seeds.
In less than an hour,
Her head was a flower
And her bum was covered in weeds.
If you make a jelly in a teapot,
and try to flop it out.
It takes about a fortnight,
To get it out the spout.
Loves are made from a likeness.
Well that's what I was told.
If they were made from Au.
We would have to call them gold.
Little on a bike,
Through the village took a hike,
Mrs Johnson blocked the walk.
She will live, but still can't talk.
If there's anything in the world,
that I would like to be,
it's Shirley Bassey's microphone,
So she could sing to me.
I know she sings to everyone,
When they come to hear her.
But front row seats cost fifteen quid.
And I would be much nearer!
As I was going up the stair.
I met a man who wasn't there.
He wasn't there again today.
I wish that man would go away.
Did I ever tell you that Mrs Mc
Had twenty-three kids and she named them all?
Well, she did. And that wasn't a smart thing to do.
You see, when she wants one and calls out, "Yoo-Hoo!
Come into the house!" she doesn't get ONE.
All twenty-threes of hers come on the run!
This makes things quite difficult at the Mc's.
As you can imagine, with so manys.
And often she wishes that, when they were born,
She had named one of them Brodkin Van Horn
And one of them Hoos-Foos. And one of them Snimm.
And one of them Hot-Shot. And one Sunny Jim.
And one of them Shadrach. And one of them Blinkey.
And one of them Stuffy. And one of them Stinkey.
Another one Putt-Putt. Another one Moon Face.
Another one Marvin O'Gravel Balloon Face.
And one of them Ziggy. And one Soggy Muff.
One Buffalo Bill. And one Biffalo Buff.
And one of them Aneepy. And one Weepy Weed.
And one Paris Garters. And one Harris Tweed.
And one of them Sir Michael Carmichael Zutt.
And one of them Oliver Boliver Butt
And one of them Zanzibar Buck-Buck Mcfate...
But she didn't do it. And now it's too late.# 171-text-gen
