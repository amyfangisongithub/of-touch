INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, WAITING ROOM - DAY
A PAINTING displays an idyllic landscape, bathed in
institutional fluorescent lighting. Off-screen, we hear
sounds of a Chinese announcement amidst other bustling
hospital sounds.
A phone buzzes, answered by an authoritative female voice.
NAI NAI (O.S.)
[Hello?]
[*Note: All Chinese Mandarin dialogue in brackets. Other
languages will not be subtitled.]
NAI NAI (80) walks into frame holding a cell phone. A head of
neatly-permed white hair, this woman is the consummate
matriarch.
BILLI (O.S.)
[Nai Nai. Hi!]
Hearing her granddaughter’s cheerful voice, Nai Nai breaks
into a warm smile.
NAI NAI
[Billi! It’s the middle of the
night there, why aren’t you
sleeping?]
BILLI (O.S.)
[Middle of the night? It’s
seven...]
NAI NAI
[Seven at night?]
EXT. NYC - EVENING
Horns BLARE as BILLI WANG (30) walks quickly through the
kinetic streets of New York City. She’s in her element here.
Her movement is effortless, even as she switches between
speaking Mandarin and English.
WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEIR PHONE CONVERSATION.
BILLI
[Yea, it's always twelve hours time
difference! Isn’t it seven in the
morning in China?]
NAI NAI
[It’s almost seven thirty!]
(beat)
(MORE)
(beat)
(MORE)
[Is it cold there? Are you wearing
enough? Cold travels through the
head! Are you wearing a hat?]
BILLI
[I am.]
(she’s definitely not)
[Stop worrying about me!]
NAI NAI
[You have to be careful. I read
that in New York there are men who
steal your earrings. They rip them
out! And then you have to go to the
hospital to get your ears stitched
up!]
BILLI
[I’m not wearing earrings, Nai
Nai!]
NAI NAI
[Ah. So you heard too.]
A loud Chinese ANNOUNCEMENT blares through the phone.
BILLI
[Hey, what’s that sound? Nai Nai,
where are you?]
The announcement continues.
NAI NAI
[Me? I’m... I'm at your great
aunt’s house.]
Clearly in a hospital, Nai Nai tells this lie with total
ease.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[What are you doing?]
BILLI
[I’m heading to Mom and Dad’s for
dinner...]
Before Billi can finish, a STREET CANVASSER interrupts with
performative cheerfulness.
STREET CANVASSER
Hi! Do you have a minute to save
the polar bears?
Billi stares blankly, annoyed by the interruption.
BILLI
I really wanna say something
snarky, but I used to have your
job.
STREET CANVASSER
(still smiling)
So you know how important it is to
support us!
BILLI
I know your job sucks.
Suddenly sympathetic, Billi stops.
BILLI (CONT’D)
(on phone)
[Hold on, Nai Nai...]
She pulls out her wallet. All she has is a dollar. She hands
it to the stranger, who eyes it cynically.
STREET CANVASSER
Lemme guess, you got fired?
BILLI
(feigns being offended)
I quit!
(beat, with a laugh)
Cuz I was about to get fired!
Billi and the canvasser share a laugh before Billi returns
her attention to Nai Nai.
BILLI (CONT’D)
[Sorry, Nai Nai.]
NAI NAI
[What was that?]
BILLI
[Nothing. Just um... a friend...]
Another announcement blares through the hospital speakers.
BILLI (CONT’D)
[Hey, Nai Nai, what is that? What’s
going on?]
NAI NAI
[It’s nothing. I’ll call you back
later, OK?]
Nai Nai’s abruptness catches Billi slightly off-guard. 
BILLI
Uh, OK...
NAI NAI
[I’ll call you back granddaughter!
I promise I’ll call you back!]
BILLI
OK. [Call me la...]
The line clicks before Billi can finish. It’s odd, but Billi
shrugs it off and descends into the subway station.
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, CT SCAN MACHINE - DAY
The bed slides out of the machine. A RADIOLOGIST helps Nai
Nai sit up.
RADIOLOGIST
[You can get dressed.]
NAI NAI
[Where's my sister?]
RADIOLOGIST
[She’s with the doctor.]
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, DOCTOR WU'S OFFICE - DAY
Little Nai Nai sits alone across from DOCTOR WU. Though we
don’t hear their conversation, Little Nai Nai absorbs what is
clearly terrible news.
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - DAY
Little Nai Nai is overwhelmed with grief, but there’s no time
for this. Her mind races. Then, with a deep breath, she makes
her decision. Yes, it’s clear what she must do.
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, WAITING ROOM - DAY
Little Nai Nai approaches her distressed sister in the
waiting room. She musters up a believable smile.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[OK, let's go.]
Her voice is light and bright.
NAI NAI
[Did you talk to the doctor?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Yep. You're in full health.] 
NAI NAI
[Really? What about the CT scan?
What about the spots they saw
before?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[It's all clear. Turned out to be
nothing. Just... benign shadows.]
NAI NAI
[Benign shadows? What's that mean?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
(shrugs nonchalantly)
[That's just what the doctor said.]
Nai Nai seems uncertain as she looks at her sister’s beaming
smile. Little Nai Nai helps her stand, still radiating with
optimism.
As they leave the hospital, Nai Nai seems sufficiently
convinced.
HAIYAN (O.S.)
(prelap)
... and one day the wife goes out
of town. When she returns, her
husband greets her right away, and
he says, 'honey your cat is dead.'
INT. WANG FAMILY HOME, DINING ROOM (QUEENS, NYC) - NIGHT
HAIYAN WANG (late 50’s), also known as DAD, smiles with selfassurance as family and friends anticipate the rest of his
joke.
Billi watches her father adoringly, sipping brandy around the
remains of their dinner.
HAIYAN
The wife gets very upset, you know?
She says to her husband, how can
you be so insensitive? You just
tell me so abruptly like this?
Despite his slight Chinese accent, Haiyan's a natural
storyteller.
HAIYAN (CONT’D)
Her husband is you know, confused!
He says to his wife... OK, how do
you want me to tell you in the
future? She says, “You have to not
be so direct. It’s too sudden.
(MORE)
5.
You have to, you know, be more
gentle in delivering the news. For
example, ease me in with something
like ‘Listen, honey... your cat...
it got on the roof...’”
A few scattered chuckles from the table. JIAN LU, also known
as MOM (late 50's), enters with plates of cake.
KATHY
Oh my gosh, I’m stuffed. I don’t
know if I have room for dessert.
Haiyan is slightly irritated by the interruption.
HAIYAN
Come, sit down...
BILLI
Come, Mom.
HAIYAN
Where was I? Oh right... A few
months go by. The wife goes out of
town again. When she returns home,
her husband’s there to greet her
again. This time, he learned his
lesson. When his wife comes through
the door, he says, ”Listen, honey,
you know, your Mom... she got on
the roof...”
The table bursts into laughter. Even Billi and Jian chuckle,
despite having heard the joke a million times.
INT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Sound of KEYS in the dark as Billi lets herself in. She’s
greeted by a LOUD CRASH - like a vase shattering. Billi drops
her mail, suddenly on guard. She’s scared, but ready to
defend herself.
Something FLIES overhead, knocking items off a shelf. Billi’s
eyes dart across the room, spotting the culprit.
A SMALL HOUSE BIRD on the windowsill. Billi’s eyes meet the
bird’s. Both parties are equally stunned. As she collects
herself, she realizes all the windows are closed.
BILLI
How'd you get in here?
The bird stares up with its beady eyes. Billi opens a window
to let it out. The traumatized bird doesn’t move. 
Billi’s phone buzzes.
NAI NAI (O.S.)
[Hi Billi. Sorry I hung up
earlier.]
BILLI
[That’s OK. What’s going on?]
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT - MORNING
INTERCUT BETWEEN BILLI AND NAI NAI FOR PHONE CONVERSATION
MR. LI (80’s) shuffles past Nai Nai carrying a THERMOS of
tea. Mr. Li is the kind of man that wears the same cap
indoors, outdoors, even at weddings.
NAI NAI
(genuine relief)
[Nothing, nothing. I’m OK. You
don’t have to worry, child.]
Nai Nai notices the trail of water following Mr. Li.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[It’s leaking!]
He’s oblivious. Nai Nai taps him, then shouts louder.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[It’s leaking!]
Mr. Li shuffles unhurriedly back into the kitchen.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[This old man! So careless!]
INT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Billi picks her mail off the ground.
BILLI
[You mean Mr. Li?]
NAI NAI
[I never should’ve gotten together
with him!]
BILLI
Nai Nai!
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - MORNING
As Mr. Li wipes up the water -
7.
NAI NAI
[It’s OK, he’s going deaf. He can’t
hear me anyway.]
BILLI
[Why are you still with him?]
NAI NAI
(sighs)
[It’s been so many years. We get
by. Anyway, it’s better than living
alone. At least there’s a live body
in the house. Otherwise, when you
get up to go to the bathroom, all
you see are your own shadows.
Listen, do you have a friend yet,
my child?]
BILLI
[I um... I have lots of friends.
Nai Nai...]
NAI NAI
[I mean a special friend. I worry
about you on your own. In a big
place like New York.]
INT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - EVENING
Billi opens an envelope, pulls out a letter. A rejection from
the Guggenheim Foundation.
NAI NAI (O.S.)
[Billi? Is everything OK?]
She’s deflated, overwhelmed by the sense of failure.
BILLI
[I’m fine. I’m uh... I’m just
tired.]
And suddenly, she does seem tired. Spiritually, that is.
NAI NAI
[If you’re tired, go to bed!]
Billi nods to herself, too familiar with the way these things
get lost in translation.
BILLI
OK...
(beat)
I love you Nai Nai...
8.
NAI NAI
I lauf you, I lauf you!
These are the only words Nai Nai knows. As broken as they
sound, she says it with all her heart. Billi summons a weak
smile, just in case Nai Nai can hear her smile.
She looks back at the windowsill. It's empty. The bird is
gone.
EXT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - DAY
Billi marches out of her apartment holding an ENVELOPE. It’s
a new day. She enters the laundromat just downstairs from her
apartment.
INT. NEIGHBORHOOD LAUNDROMAT - DAY
Billi stands across from SHIRLEY (20’s), folding stacks of
laundry for customers. Her first-generation immigrant mother
attends to customers nearby. She is the LAUNDROMAT OWNER (and
landlord of the building).
LAUNDROMAT OWNER
(in another language)
Late again! She’s always late, and
she didn’t even pay last month!
Billi looks between Shirley and her mother, anxious.
BILLI
I wrote a couple pieces for this
stupid web company and they screwed
me on the payment, but look it’s
all here.
SHIRLEY
For what month?
BILLI
(confused)
This one? May?
SHIRLEY
And what happened to April’s rent?
My mom says you didn’t pay April
yet.
Billi is blind-sided as she realizes her error.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
You know if you moved out, we could
double the rent right now?
9.
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD LAUNDROMAT - DAY
Billi steps outside, realizes she’s still holding her
laundry.
INT. WANG FAMILY HOME - DAY
Billi bursts through the door carrying the laundry.
BILLI
Ma! Ba! Hello?
JIAN
Shhh! What are you doing here?
BILLI
I’ve been calling, why didn’t you
guys pick up?
JIAN
We busy. Have you eaten? I’ll make
you some wontons.
As Jian heads to the kitchen, Billi heads into the laundry
room and puts clothes into the washer.
JIAN (CONT’D)
So what, you broke? That’s why you
come. I know you... You need money,
right?
Billi tries to deflect with humor.
BILLI
No, I just love an excuse to come
see you.
JIAN
What’s going to happen to you? Are
you always going to live like this?
BILLI
Poor but sexy? I hope so.
JIAN
Why you not save? You should change
your expensive lifestyle!
BILLI
Seriously, Mom. If you’re gonna
give me shit every time I come
home, I won’t come back anymore!
10.
JIAN
Lower your voice. Dad’s sleeping!
BILLI
It's six o’clock. What’s wrong with
him?
JIAN
Nothing. He’s just resting.
BILLI
Is he OK?
Jian turns away from Billi and grabs frozen wontons from the
freezer. Her body language is evasive.
JIAN
He’s fine. We just very busy.
BILLI
Doing what? What’s going on?
JIAN
(lets out a sigh)
Hao Hao’s getting married, so we
have to go to China.
BILLI
What? Since when? Didn’t he just
start dating this girl a few months
ago?
Jian doesn’t respond, intently focused on chopping scallions.
BILLI (CONT’D)
I can’t go to China right now, Mom.
JIAN
You don’t have to go.
BILLI
He’s my only cousin, shouldn’t I be
there?
JIAN
No one expects you to go.
Billi considers this suspiciously.
BILLI
You think he knocked her up?
Jian silently continues cooking.
11.
JIAN
How many wontons you want?
BILLI
Um... Five.
JIAN
Only five? That's not enough.
BILLI
Then make a dozen.
JIAN
I think ten's good.
Billi looks around - the house is eerily quiet. Something's
not right.
INT. WANG FAMILY HOME, HALLWAY - NIGHT
Billi stares at the closed door. The light is on inside. She
knocks gently and opens the door.
INT. WANG FAMILY HOME, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Haiyan sits on the edge of the bed, facing away from Billi.
BILLI
Dad?
His stillness, his silence - it’s eerie.
BILLI (CONT’D)
What's wrong, Dad?
HAIYAN
Nothing.
BILLI
Did you and Mom get in a fight?
Haiyan fights back tears.
BILLI (CONT’D)
Have you been drinking?
More silence. Terror.
BILLI (CONT’D)
Can you please talk to me? You're
scaring me.
Billi looks up to see Jian at the door.
12.
BILLI (CONT’D)
What's going on?
More silence. Billi’s insides are shrieking.
BILLI (CONT’D)
(raises her voice)
Something's going on! Just tell me
what's going on!
JIAN
(dry, to-the-point)
Nai Nai's dying. She has lung
cancer. It's stage four.
Billi’s heart drops. She collapses onto the bed, sitting
beside her father.
BILLI
What? I just spoke to her, she
didn’t say anything...
JIAN
She doesn’t know yet.
Billi’s mind races.
BILLI
How long does she have?
JIAN
Doctor says three months, but you
never know. Could be faster.
Billi reels.
BILLI
I need to call her...
HAIYAN
No, Billi...
BILLI
I need to see her!
HAIYAN
You can't do that.
Haiyan puts aside his own grief momentarily. His words are
measured.
13.
HAIYAN (CONT’D)
She doesn’t know... And the family
thinks it’s better not to tell her.
So you can’t say anything.
BILLI
I don’t understand. She needs to
know, right?
HAIYAN
There’s nothing they can do, so
everyone decided it’s better not to
tell her.
BILLI
Why is that better?
JIAN
Chinese people have a saying. When
people get cancer, they die...
Billi squints - what the fuck?
JIAN (CONT’D)
... it's not the cancer that kills
them. It's the fear.
BILLI
What about the wedding?
Jian joins her family on the bed.
JIAN
That was your Dad’s idea. If
everyone rushed back to see her
right now, she would wonder why.
BILLI
So you’re throwing a fake wedding
to lie to her?
HAIYAN
It’s an excuse for everybody to see
her.
BILLI
When were you planning on telling
me all of this?
We’re back to silence.
14.
BILLI (CONT’D)
(accusatory)
How could you let me find out like
this?
JIAN
(defensive)
How should I have told you? ‘Oh,
your grandma’s on the roof?'
This doesn’t get a laugh, but Jian wasn’t expecting one.
BILLI
I need to go see her...
HAIYAN
You can’t.
JIAN
Everyone thinks it’s better if you
don’t go. Look at you. You can’t
hide your emotions! Nai Nai will
know right away!
BILLI
I need to say goodbye. What if she
dies and I don’t get a chance to
say goodbye?
The very thought of this makes Billi break down. Tears stream
down her face.
JIAN
You can go later. If you go right
now you’ll give it away. You can’t
help it.
INT. SUBWAY, NYC - NIGHT
Billi stares out the window, past her own reflection, her
grief apparent. Her laundry bag sits beside her.
INT. FRIEND’S HOUSE, BROOKLYN - DAY
Lit candles on a birthday cake. Everyone sings ‘happy
birthday’ for their friend TONY. Billi’s mind is clearly
elsewhere, even as she sings along.
Her mother’s right - she’s no good at hiding her emotions.
INT. NYC SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT
An ELDERLY CHINESE WOMAN waits for her train across the
tracks on the opposite platform. As Billi watches her, she
fights back emotions.
As the train arrives, we see Billi’s grief transform into
determination. She knows she must go.
As the train whisks the elderly woman away...
INT. CHANGCHUN AIRPORT, CHINA - DAY
A sea of Chinese faces. The ceiling is low, the floors are a
glossy white marble. It takes a few moments before we spot
Billi in the crowd. CHINESE VOICES echo around her.
Billi gets shoved into a stranger. As a reflex, Billi says
‘I’m sorry’ in English. The stranger responds with a flurry
of Chinese. Billi reacts, trying to orient herself.
EXT. CHANGCHUN AIRPORT, CHINA - DAY
A group of TAXI HUSTLERS target Billi, invading her personal
space. They inundate her with questions: “Do you need a
taxi?” “Where are you going?”
INT. TAXI - DAY
Billi stares out the window. Construction cranes dot the
skyline, wide streets interrupted by the skeletal frames of
unfinished buildings.
INT. TAXI, ALLEY - DAY
The DRIVER honks repeatedly as he pulls down a narrow alley.
Pedestrians and rickshaw peddlers make way for the car to
pass.
EXT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - DAY
The taxi pulls up to a complex of PEACH BUILDINGS.
Billi gets out. She stares up at the looming building, not
sure she’s prepared for the challenge she’s about to face.
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, STAIRWELL - DAY
Billi climbs the stairs. The narrow staircase is dimly lit by
a single bulb. She KNOCKS. We immediately hear barking. As
Billi waits, the automatic light goes off, leaving her in the
dark for a few brief moments.
16.
Mr. Li opens the door, letting out a shaft of cold
fluorescent light from inside the apartment.
MR. LI
[Who’s that?]
BILLI
[Mr. Li? It’s me, Billi.]
MR. LI
[Who?]
Mr. Li shouts his words, as one does when they’re losing
their hearing, and perhaps even their mind.
BILLI
Billi!
MR. LI
[Billi? What are you doing here?
Come in, come in!]
BILLI
(peering inside)
[Nai Nai?]
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
As Billi moves into the living room, everyone reacts. Nai
Nai, Haiyan, Jian.
There’s also UNCLE HAIBIN (early 60's), distinguished grey
with black-rimmed glasses. AUNTIE LING (60), quiet but
shrewd.
The pimple-faced and sheepish cousin is HAO HAO (early 20’s);
‘on the brink of tears’ is his eternal state of being. AIKO
is his sweet but confused Japanese bride.
NAI NAI
[Billi? Oh my god, Billi’s here!]
HAIYAN
Why'd you come?
LITTLE NAI NAI
[What are you doing here? We all
thought you weren’t coming!]
JIAN
How’d you get here?
They talk AT her, all at once. Nai Nai is the only one who
seems pleased by this surprise. In fact, she’s overjoyed.
17.
NAI NAI
[Billi! Billi! What are you doing
here you stupid child?]
Nai Nai approaches Billi, analyzing her.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Let me look at you. Oh you’re not
that skinny! Your Mom said you got
skinny, but you’re not that
skinny!]
Nai Nai embraces Billi. Billi’s throat swells shut. Her mouth
quivers as tears flood to her eyes.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Oh my granddaughter! Why didn’t
you tell me you were coming? I’ve
been trying to call you all week!]
A deer in headlights, Billi doesn’t speak, as if the secret
would spill out if she opened her mouth. Family members
observe her carefully, exchanging looks of concern.
Nai Nai kisses her all over her face. Billi fights for
control of her emotions.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Your mother said you were too busy
to come!]
Billi opens her mouth and still, nothing comes out.
Anticipation lingers in the air.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[What’s wrong with you? Why aren’t
you talking?]
Billi looks at her family, then back at Nai Nai. She swallows
hard. After a few long beats -
BILLI
[I missed you.]
NAI NAI
[Sure, but your work comes first.
You shouldn’t have come if you’re
so busy. How’d you get here? Did
you fly?]
Billi musters a smile.
BILLI
[No, I swam...]
18.
Nai Nai laughs and slaps her on the butt. The tension begins
to subside.
HAIYAN
You should’ve called.
Nai Nai pats Billi's butt as they all head back to the couch.
NAI NAI
[Silly child. This butt. This butt
never changes! I’ve always loved
this little round butt. Come sit!]
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT
A meat pie fries in the pan. Jian is at the stove as MRS. GAO
(40’s) chops veggies and Little Nai Nai kneads dough.
Billi peers in and hugs Little Nai Nai.
BILLI
[Little Nai Nai...]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Billi! You must be starving. I'm
making your favorite - meat pies!
It's your favorite, right? I
remember it's your favorite.]
BILLI
[Looks great...]
As Mrs. Gao crosses.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Billi, this is Mrs. Gao.]
MRS. GAO
[You’re the granddaughter! You came
home too!]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Last time you were here, we still
had Ms. Jin, right?]
BILLI
[Ms. Jin? I remember Mrs. Ma?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Mrs. Ma was four maids ago! Has it
been that long since you’ve been
back?]
19.
Billi turns her attention to Jian, who stands over a frying
pan, giving her the cold shoulder. Billi bear hugs her mother
from behind.
JIAN
Stop fooling around! The oil's hot!
BILLI
Don’t be mad, Mom.
JIAN
How you buy ticket here? Credit
card, right?
BILLI
Don’t worry. It's all fine, Mom.
Look at my face. Look.
Billi gives her the widest possible smile. Jian stifles a
chuckle, too proud to give in. She feigns stoicism and shoves
a plate of meat pies into Billi's hands.
JIAN
Go put these on the table.
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, DINING TABLE - NIGHT
The family eats, making small talk about the food. Billi
scans the table, watching everyone devour meat pies.
Nai Nai beams at the sight of the entire family around the
table.
NAI NAI
[It’s been far too long since we’ve
all been united like this.]
AUNTIE LING
[What's it been? 20 years?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Haiyan left China 25 years ago.
And you guys left for Japan soon
after.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[That's a long time.]
HAIYAN
[Time flies...]
Mrs. Gao comes out with a plate of piping hot meat pies.
20.
MRS. GAO
[These are hot. Eat these fresh
ones!]
NAI NAI
[Look at these two wonderful
grandchildren of mine!]
Nai Nai playfully touches Billi and Hao Hao.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[You see... my granddaughter is
very strong. Independent. Not
someone who just follows everyone
else.]
Billi swallows.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Hao Hao was always a sensitive
child, but look at him now. All
grown up and getting married! I’ve
been looking forward to this day
for a long time.]
AUNTIE LING
[Too bad neither of them speak
Chinese very well!]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Hao Hao’s Chinese is fine. He’s
just being shy. Hao Hao, talk to
Nai Nai in Chinese!]
Everyone stares at Hao Hao. He reluctantly obeys, speaking
slowly in his broken Chinese.
HAO HAO
[Nai Nai... We don’t need a big
wedding banquet. We just came to
spend time with you.]
NAI NAI
[Don’t be ridiculous! You guys came
back home to get married. We must
have a proper wedding banquet.]
AUNTIE LING
[Let’s just keep it small. We don’t
need to go overboard.]
21.
NAI NAI
[Stop it! Everything’s already
booked and I sent out invitations
last week! My only grandson’s
getting married, we can’t look
cheap!]
Little Nai Nai picks at her food. Everyone turns their focus
to the food, chewing intently. Hao Hao is, quite reliably, on
the brink of tears.
Nai Nai suddenly notices Billi’s untouched meat pie.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
(accusatory)
[Why aren't you eating?]
Billi stares down at her plate, unable to work up an
appetite.
BILLI
[I’m not hungry.]
NAI NAI
[How can you not be hungry? You’ve
been traveling for 24 hours. Eat,
eat.]
Nai Nai picks up the meat pie and feeds it to Billi. Always a
child in her grandmother’s eyes, Billi takes a reluctant
bite.
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
Billi closes the door. She lets out a breath as she sits on
the toilet - a moment of refuge.
On the wall in front of her is a poster of a chubby, overly
cheerful baby. Underneath, in Chinese, it reads:
They all say I'm adorable.
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT
Passing Nai Nai’s bedroom, Billi notices details of her
simple life: the neatly-made bed, framed photos of Billi
surround the room. In the next bedroom, Mr. Li shuffles
around loudly in his slippers. He hacks up a loogie.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, DINING TABLE - NIGHT
Billi returns to the table in a daze. Nai Nai turns to look
at her with concern.
22.
NAI NAI
[What’s wrong?]
The threat of being exposed lingers in the air.
BILLI
[I’m fine.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[It's probably the jet-lag. Come,
I’ll take you to the hotel.]
BILLI
[Hotel? Why can't I stay here? I
always stay here.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[With so many people visiting, it's
easier if everyone stays at a
hotel. It’s very close.]
NAI NAI
[Don't worry, it's an excellent
hotel. It’s brand new.]
Billi swallows her disappointment.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Go get some rest. We have a lot to
do the next couple days before the
wedding.]
The family’s eyes linger on her, menacing.
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD ALLEY - NIGHT
Billi and Uncle Haibin walk side by side in awkward silence.
They pass street vendors wrapped in smoke and incandescent
lighting, selling meat skewers off their grills.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Nai Nai is very sick, you know?]
He speaks in an eerily calm, matter-of-fact tone. Not sure if
the question is rhetorical, Billi answers.
BILLI
[I know.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Nai Nai herself doesn't know.
We're not going to tell her.]
23.
BILLI
[I know. Dad told me.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
(not listening)
[She doesn't have long left. We got
several opinions already. I also
spoke to a doctor in Japan. A
cancer specialist.]
Billi stares straight ahead, unengaged. This doesn’t deter
Uncle Haibin.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
[I got her some medicine. It was
expensive.]
BILLI
(hopeful)
[From the Japanese doctor?]
UNCLE HAIBIN
(matter-of-factly)
[From the internet.]
Billi is at a loss for words. More awkward silence.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
[Nai Nai... she loves you so much,
you know?]
BILLI
[I know.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[You and Hao Hao spent every summer
with her and grandpa until you
moved to the US. But you were very
little then, so you probably don’t
remember.]
BILLI
[I remember.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[She doesn’t know. So you have to
be very careful not to tell her.]
It feels like he’s testing her. Billi’s patience wears thin.
She raises her voice.
BILLI
[I know! Dad already told me!]
24.
Like a broken record, Uncle Haibin’s tone remains consistent.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[She doesn’t know a thing.]
Billi relinquishes with a sigh. As they continue on, their
repetitious dialogue falls into pace with their walking.
BILLI
[I know.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[We’re not planning on telling
her.]
BILLI
[I know.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[No matter how sad you feel, you
cannot say anything.]
Billi stares ahead as they head into a brightly lit
commercial district.
BILLI
[I know.]
INT. HOTEL BEST, LOBBY - NIGHT
Billi and Uncle Haibin stand across from MICHAEL (late 20's),
the hotel manager.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[What do you mean the elevator
broke? Isn't this a newly opened
hotel?]
MICHAEL
[We're working on it. Come come,
I'll carry this.]
A group of lively BUSINESSMEN and MISTRESSES walk in. Billi
studies them - clearly in the hotel for a different reason.
BUSINESSMAN #1
[We want the same room as last
time.]
MICHAEL
[I'll check for you.]
Michael finds their key for them.
UNCLE HAIBIN
(to Billi)
[You're OK, right? I'm gonna head
back. Get some sleep.]
Billi nods and he leaves.
INT. HOTEL BEST, STAIRS - NIGHT
Billi follows Michael upstairs. Several flights later, she
stops to catch her breath.
BILLI
[Are we almost there?]
MICHAEL
[Almost there! It's not much
higher.]
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
[Are you visiting from abroad?]
BILLI
[Yes.]
MICHAEL
[From where?]
BILLI
[America.]
MICHAEL
[America? You don't look American.]
This makes Billi pause, but she’s used to it.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
[What are you here for?]
Billi debates which answer to give him. She decides on the
lie.
BILLI
[A wedding.]
MICHAEL
(beat)
[Who’s getting married?]
BILLI
[My...] cousin.
(remembers the Chinese)
‘Tang di.’
26.
MICHAEL
[Oh your cousin. He’s also from
America?]
BILLI
[No, they live in Japan.]
INT. HOTEL BEST, HALLWAY - NIGHT
Michael lets Billi into her room.
INT. HOTEL BEST, BILLI’S ROOM - NIGHT
Billi surveys the room as Michael drops off her bag.
MICHAEL
[Japan?! What are they doing in
Japan?]
BILLI
[I don’t know. My uncle’s an
artist. He paints.]
The odd-patterned carpet, the strange paintings, the
wallpaper - it all clashes, yet somehow, it works.
MICHAEL
[And what does your father do in
America?]
BILLI
[He’s a translator, do you have
water? For drinking?]
MICHAEL
[You can use the boiler.]
Michael points to an ELECTRIC BOILER.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
[So tell me, what’s better? China
or America?]
BILLI
[Uh... they’re different.]
Billi tries to usher him towards the door, but he continues
to linger.
MICHAEL
[What do you mean different? It
must be much nicer over there.]
27.
BILLI
[It’s just... I don’t know,
different.]
MICHAEL
[But you’re probably more used to
America, right?]
BILLI
[I guess...]
She continues to inch him out the door.
MICHAEL
[Well let me know if you need
anything else.]
BILLI
[K thanks. Bye.]
INT. HOTEL BEST, BILLI’S ROOM - LATER
Billi fills the boiler. She sits on the edge of the bed,
literally waiting for the water to boil.
NAI NAI (O.S.)
(prelap)
HA!
EXT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - MORNING
Nai Nai swings her arms, hitting herself all over her body.
Her face beams, her eyes sparkle. She’s full of life and
Billi seems like a drag in comparison.
NAI NAI
[Come Billi! Do it with me! It’s
good for you!]
Billi does a weak imitation of Nai Nai’s exercise.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[No, stronger. HA! It clears out
all the bad toxins. Then you
inhale, take in lots of fresh
oxygen. HA! You do it. You also
have to slap yourself to get the
circulation going.
(demonstrates slapping)
Slap your arms. Slap your legs.
Slap your back like this... Try
it!]
28.
Humoring her grandmother, Billi obeys her orders and laughs
at herself. For a moment, she forgets the circumstances of
her visit.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Good! Bigger! From your gut.]
For a moment, they revel in the joy of slapping and shouting.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, STAIRWELL - MORNING
Nai Nai’s knuckles turn white from her grip on the railing,
pulling herself up one step at a time.
It pains Billi to see this. She tries to help.
NAI NAI
[I’m alright, I got it. I come down
by myself every morning.]
BILLI
[Doesn’t that hurt your legs?]
NAI NAI
[Even so, I have to come down to
exercise. It’s the reason I’m so
healthy. Even at my age!]
Billi swallows, unable to contradict her.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, DINING TABLE - MORNING
Billi and Mrs. Gao set out Chinese breakfast foods.
The door bell rings and Chen YuPing (40’s) waltzes in. (We’ll
refer to her as GU GU, which is Chinese for Aunt). She has
the hip confident style of someone much younger and exudes an
attitude of success.
GU GU
[Billi! I heard you came!]
Gu Gu's son LITTLE BAO (8) trails in behind her, playing on
his iPhone. Bao is what the Chinese call a little emperor -
pampered and well-fed.
GU GU (CONT’D)
[You remember Bao, right? Bao! Say
hi to the big sister!]
BILLI
[Little Bao, you've gotten so big!]
29.
BAO
(barks)
[It's not Little Bao! I’m just
called Bao!]
Nai Nai calls everyone to attention.
NAI NAI
[Alright, alright hurry up and eat
breakfast! We have a big day
ahead!]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Have you taken your pills?]
NAI NAI
[I'll take them later.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[You have to remember to take them
every day, or there's no point!
Where are they?]
NAI NAI
[Next to my bed. Come you guys! Eat
before the food gets cold!]
AUNTIE LING
[Ma, you sit!]
As everyone finally takes their seat -
NAI NAI
[OK, listen to me all of you. I
know everyone's excited to see me,
but let's not forget why we're all
here.]
Furtive glances around the table. Nai Nai gestures to Hao Hao
and Aiko.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[The wedding is the big event.]
As if they really had forgotten, they all nod a little too
enthusiastically.
HAIYAN
(mutters unconvincingly)
[Yes... that's right. The wedding
is the big event.]
30.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
As Jian helps Mrs. Gao clean up, Nai Nai sidles up to her.
NAI NAI
[Jian, something's off about Haiyan
on this trip. Have you noticed? His
face is all puffy and discolored.
He seems very unhappy.]
JIAN
[He's fine, Ma.]
NAI NAI
[He just looks so tired. Is he
still drinking? You can’t let him
drink. Alcohol can ruin a person. I
know so many men around here who
have drank themselves to death.]
JIAN
[He barely drinks at home anymore.]
NAI NAI
[Is everything OK between you two?]
JIAN
[Everything's fine. We're fine.]
NAI NAI
[I know you guys have had your
issues in the past...]
JIAN
(defensive)
[It's got nothing to do with us.
We're doing great!]
NAI NAI
[You shouldn’t have him work so
much. It’s too much pressure for
one person to support your entire
family...]
Was that a jab at her?
JIAN
[I told him to close the office and
retire, but he refuses! He feels
useless at home if he has nothing
to do. He loves being surrounded by
people who need him - clients
always coming to him...
(MORE)
31.
oh Mr. Wang, help me with this,
help me with that.]
NAI NAI
(nods)
[Well it’s also good to have
something to do. Being idle can be
bad for your health. He just
doesn’t know how to take care of
himself. You have to think about
him more. Give him lots of
medicine. Let’s put it this way -
if he’s not well, you can’t live
well either. Right?]
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, DINING TABLE - MORNING
As Nai Nai rejoins the table, she clocks Haiyan again.
Something’s definitely not right.
Uncle hands her a couple pills. Nai Nai clocks Billi’s
concerned look.
NAI NAI
[They're just vitamins. Your uncle
bought them from Japan. He says
they’re expensive so they must be
good. Japanese people know how to
take care of themselves!]
Mr. Li gets up from the table silently.
AUNTIE LING
[Uncle Li, you’re done eating?]
NAI NAI
[Don’t mind him. That’s how he is!
He eats and leaves. He doesn’t care
about anything that doesn’t concern
him!]
Mr. Li is immune to Nai Nai’s insults. Nai Nai tries to serve
food. Everyone yells: Sit down! Serve yourself! Hurry up and
eat!
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[I want to talk to you all about
something. If anyone asks, none of
you are to say that Hao Hao and his
bride have only been dating three
months.]
JIAN (CONT'D)
32.
AUNTIE LING
[Ma, I already told you, Aiko's not
pregnant.]
NAI NAI
[Doesn’t matter! You know how
people think! I don’t want
everybody talking behind our backs.
If anyone asks, just say they’ve
been dating 6 months.]
JIAN
(sarcastic)
[Why not just say a year then?]
NAI NAI
[Good idea. A year sounds better.
The wedding banquet is in three
days. We have so much to do. I need
someone to come see the banquet
hall with me.]
BILLI
[I’ll go.]
NAI NAI
[You don’t need to come. You won’t
be much help anyway.]
HAIYAN
[Ma, I can come.]
NAI NAI
[No you need to rest! Look at your
face - it’s not right!]
HAIBIN
[Why don’t you stay home and rest,
Ma? I’ll go check on the banquet
hall.]
NAI NAI
[You don’t even know who to talk
to! I have to go myself.]
BILLI
[What can I do, Nai Nai?]
NAI NAI
[Nothing. You don’t look great
either, must still be the jet lag.]
33.
GU GU
[What if I take them to the massage
parlor?]
NAI NAI
[That’s a great idea!]
BILLI
[Nai Nai I want to come with you.]
NAI NAI
[No, you guys go relax. You better
not get sick before the wedding!]
Nai Nai piles more food on Billi's plate, then shoves a
doughy cruller in her own mouth.
INT. GRAND HOTEL, BANQUET HALL - DAY
Nai Nai and Uncle Haibin stand across from the WEDDING
COORDINATOR in an empty banquet hall. Nai Nai is visibly
upset.
NAI NAI
[It’s not right! I ordered meal set
one! When I booked the wedding, you
guys told me meal set one would
come with lobster. That’s what you
said. Now you act like you don’t
know anything about it?]
WEDDING COORDINATOR
[I really don’t know anything about
that. I was told it’s crab, but I
can check with the chef.
(screams)
Little Ping! Little Ping!]
LITTLE PING, a young cook dressed in a tall chef’s hat wakes
from a nap at a nearby table.
WEDDING COORDINATOR (CONT’D)
[Go get the chef!]
Little Ping drags himself into the kitchen.
WEDDING COORDINATOR (CONT’D)
[Why don’t you look at the alcohol
options in the meantime. We have
baijiu, red wine, white wine,
beer...]
NAI NAI
[We also have champagne.]
